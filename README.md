The task involves developing a Spring Boot RESTful application for an Automobile Company to manage CRUD operations for two main resources: "Vehicle" and "User." Here's a description of the key functionalities and requirements:

1. Add New Vehicle:

- Implement an endpoint to allow the addition of new vehicles.
- The payload for adding a vehicle should include fields like Vname, Company, Vnumber, Vtype, and Uid.
- The Id field is auto-generated and starts from 1.
- Perform validation on the payload to ensure that mandatory fields are not blank and meet specific criteria.
- Store the vehicle details in a MySQL relational database.
- Fetch Vehicles for Given User:

2. Create an endpoint to fetch all vehicles associated with a given user.
- Require the user's name as input to retrieve the vehicles.
- Ensure error handling in case the user does not exist, providing a relevant message.

3. Delete Vehicle Records for Given User:

- Implement an endpoint to delete vehicle records for a specified user.
- Accept the user's name as input for identifying the records to delete.
- Provide appropriate error handling if the user does not exist.

4. Resource Attributes:

- Define the attributes for the "Vehicle" and "User" resources according to the provided specifications.
- Ensure that mandatory fields are not nullable and meet specific requirements.
- Handle the validation of fields like Vname, Vtype, Vnumber, etc.

5. Payload Validation:

- Implement payload validation to ensure that required fields are not blank and meet specific criteria.
- Validate fields such as Vname, Vtype, Vnumber, etc., for correctness and completeness.

6. REST URL Naming:

- Follow REST best practices for naming RESTful endpoints.
- Ensure that endpoint names are intuitive and descriptive of the operations they perform.

7. Response Codes and Error Handling:

- Return appropriate HTTP response codes as per REST guidelines (e.g., 201 for resource creation, 404 for not found, 200 for OK).
- Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures and provide informative error messages to clients.

8. Optional: Global Exception Handling:

- Consider implementing global exception handling to centralize error handling logic and improve maintainability.

By fulfilling these requirements, the Spring Boot application will provide robust CRUD operations for managing "Vehicle" and "User" resources in an Automobile Company setting, ensuring data integrity, validation, and adherence to RESTful principles.
